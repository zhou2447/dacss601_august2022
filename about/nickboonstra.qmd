## Education/Work Background
Started university at Boston University studying physics. Financial issues kept me from continuing. Spent some time at Bunker Hill Community College. Transferred to UMass Lowell; finished with a Bachelor's in Liberal Arts with concentrations in Political Science and Writing. I also have customer service work experience in banking, food service, and theatre.

## R experience
None before this summer!

## Research interests
Partisanship and polarization, and the effects these have on the disparate perceptions of reality that Americans currently hold.

## Hometown
I grew up in Leominster, MA. After living in Boston for a few years, and in Lowell for a few more, I have just moved to Chicopee.

## Hobbies
Following English & European football, playing chess, playing guitar, dabbling in solving & constructing crosswords...

## Fun fact
I once took a one-night trip from Boston to London to see a football match!
