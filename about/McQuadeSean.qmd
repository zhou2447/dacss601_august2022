## Education/Work Background

I am an undergraduate studying economics with minors in mathematics and philosophy. I will be working as an intern in the DACSS program this Fall.

## R experience

I have used the basics of R working as a research assistant in the Economics Department this past year, but am looking to gain more of a foundational understanding of the program through taking this course.

## Research interests

My work as a research assistant has been centered around elite networks, corporate responses to social movements, and most recently, corporate nepotism.

## Hometown

Shrewsbury, MA

## Hobbies

Rock climbing, hiking, and reading

## Fun fact

I know how to juggle!
